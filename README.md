# Interpretable Customer Churn Prediction — README
Project Overview
This project focuses on interpretable machine learning for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company. Using the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset (or a similar Telco dataset), the goal is not only to achieve high predictive performance but also to generate actionable business insights using modern explainability tools:

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for global model interpretation
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) for individual-level decisions
The project connects data science modeling with business intelligence, providing transparent and explainable churn predictions.

Learning Objectives
Students will:

Prepare and preprocess a real-world customer churn dataset
Engineer domain-relevant features to improve model performance
Train and tune a complex classification model (XGBoost / LightGBM)
Explain global patterns using SHAP
Explain individual predictions using LIME
Synthesise business recommendations based on interpretability results
Dataset Information
This project uses a telecommunications churn dataset such as:

IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset
Link: (publicly available — Kaggle / IBM sample datasets)

Key Columns
The dataset typically includes:

Customer Demographics

Gender
SeniorCitizen
Partner
Dependents
Service Subscription

PhoneService
InternetService
StreamingTV
TechSupport
OnlineBackup
DeviceProtection
StreamingMovies
Account Information

Contract
PaperlessBilling
PaymentMethod
MonthlyCharges
TotalCharges
TenureMonths
Target Variable

Churn Label → Yes/No
Your source code handles:

Missing values
Data type inconsistencies (especially Total Charges)
Feature engineering
Transformation pipelines
Pipeline Summary
1. Feature Engineering
Your code creates the following additional engineered variables:

Feature	Description
num_services	Number of subscribed telecom services
avg_charge_per_service	Monthly charge divided by number of services
tenure_bin	Categorical tenure grouping
AutoPay	Indicator for automatic payment methods
contract_term	Numeric mapping of contract length
These are domain-driven and increase the model's predictive power.

2. Model Development
The pipeline:

Splits dataset (train/test stratified)

Preprocesses:

StandardScaler → numeric features
OneHotEncoder → categorical features
Trains an XGBoostClassifier

Performs RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

Reports baseline & final performance:

AUC
F1-score
Saves model to churn_outputs/xgb_churn_model.joblib

3. SHAP: Global Explainability
Your script:

Computes SHAP values for the trained XGBoost model

Ranks global top 5 features by mean(|SHAP|)

Saves:

shap_summary.png
shap_feature_importance.csv
global_shap_summary.txt
The global report explains:

Which variables drive churn the most
The magnitude of their contribution
Whether they increase or decrease churn likelihood
4. LIME: Local Explainability
Five customers are selected:

2 highest churn probabilities
2 lowest churn probabilities
1 closest to 0.50 probability (ambiguous case)
The script outputs:

HTML files (interactive LIME explanations)
local_lime_summary.txt
local_explanations.json
Each record includes:

Prediction and true label
Influential features for that individual
5. Business Recommendation Synthesis
The script generates:

actionable_strategies.txt
Recommendations include:

Preventing churn among month-to-month customers
Incentivizing AutoPay adoption
Tailoring retention strategies for seniors
Offering bundles for customers with high charges but low service usage
Output Folder Structure
After running the script, you will get:

churn_outputs/ │ ├── xgb_churn_model.joblib ├── metrics.json ├── shap_summary.png ├── shap_feature_importance.csv ├── global_shap_summary.txt ├── local_explanations.json ├── local_lime_summary.txt ├── actionable_strategies.txt └── lime_explanation_idx_*.html (five separate files)

How to Use the Dataset in This Project
Place your dataset file in the project directory:
Telco_customer_churn.csv

Ensure the dataset contains required columns like:
Churn Label
Monthly Charges
Tenure Months
Total Charges
Contract/service billing columns
Run the script:
bash python churn_script.py

Review outputs in the churn_outputs/ folder.
Expected Deliverables (as per assignment)
Deliverable	Description
Python Source Code	Complete modeling + preprocessing + explainability script
Global SHAP Report	Top 5 churn drivers + explanations
Local LIME Report	5 customer-level prediction explanations
Business Strategy Document	3–4 actionable retention insights
All are automatically generated by the provided script.

Final Notes
This project is structured to meet the expectations of advanced analytics coursework.
Interpretability is emphasized just as much as model accuracy.
The dataset plays a central role in enabling domain-specific feature engineering.
